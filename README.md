## Getting started
### Invite
- By using this bot you agree to the terms laid out in the [Privacy & Terms](./docs/privacy-and-terms.md) document
- If you agree, you can use my [public invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=575115003875688448&scope=bot&permissions=268454912) to invite the bot to your server
- See the [self hosting section](#self-hosting) for details on running on your own server

### Setup
**Admin only**
Setup requires administrator permission in the Discord server
1. Create a role (or choose an existing one) to use to mark active users
2. Make your chosen role *mentionable* (only needed until setup is complete)
3. Put the bot's role *higher* in the list than your chosen role
4. Run `@Activity Monitor setup` in a channel the bot can *read* and *write* in
	- If you've nicknamed the bot, substitute `@Activity Monitor` for it's nickname
5. Respond with the information the bot asks you for, until setup is complete

- You can view your guild settings with `@Activity Monitor view-config`

### Permissions

The bot requires certain permissions, which you are prompted for on the invite screen.
Each permission has a reason for being required, explained below.

| Permission     | Reason                                                                |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read messsages | Detect when people are active                                         |
| Send messages  | Used to ask setup questions (can be disabled after setup is complete) |
| Manage roles   | Assign and remove the active role from users                          |
| Embed links    | Responses to 'help' requests use message embeds for nice formatting   |

## Self hosting
1. Install [Node.js v10](https://nodejs.org/en/) and 
2. Clone the repository, or download and extract the zip file (preferrably from the [release page](https://github.com/benji7425/discord-activity-monitor/releases))
3. Add a file named *token* in the root folder; paste in your bot token
3. Run `npm run full-start` to compile and run the bot
	- If you see yellow 'WARN' messages about peer dependencies, you can safely ignore these

### Git users  
If you cloned the repository with git, make sure you `git reset --hard vX.Y` to a specific version, as latest master isn't always production ready!

### Database
- Out of the box the project uses [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb/) as a local database, storing the data in *./nedb-data*
- Both [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) are supported
- Edit the connection string in [config.json](./config.json) or by setting the *DB_STRING* environment variable

### Docker
`docker run -v /path/to/logs:/app/logs -v /path/to/data:/app/nedb-data -e TOKEN="your-token-here" -e DB_STRING="your-db-string-here" benji7425/discord-activity-monitor`

- **Due to limitations with volume mounting cross-OS you cannost use a Windows host with the inbuilt NeDB database**
- View the image on Docker Hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/benji7425/discord-activity-monitor)
- You can omit the *DB_STRING* environment variable if using the default local *nedb-data* database
- You can omit the *nedb-data* volume mount if connecting to a MongoDB instance
